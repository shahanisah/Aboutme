<p>	Assalamualaikum W.B.T to my lecturer Sir Firdaus for teaching me, during my last semester in Diploma Information Management for subject Introduction To Web Content Management And Design (IMD 311). Even though, during this pandemic we cannot attend classes and learning through online only, but we manage to study for this semester with the help from sir. Without sir, to face this semester might be the hardest in my experience as a student. Moreover, by learning this subject i got many new experiences and i be more understanding about this business activity and knowledge. 
<br><br><br>
	Then, not to forget my friends that helping me especially during complete this individual assignment. To make more clear, i want to say thank you so much towards my fellow friends that always remind me to finish this assignment and for always reply my massages every time i asked them. without them, i might have a hard time to do this assignment and thank you so much for giving me aspiration, idea, and motivation to complete this assignment. 
<br><br><br>
	Lastly, i want to say thank you so much to my beloved family for understanding me while I am doing my assignment and online learning because without their understanding i might feel guilty for my attitude that always shut myself in my room. Also, thank you so much for giving me a hand whenever i need help and motivation.</p>
